# Pizza Place

This project is a pizza delivery application developed using react native.

## Project Features

* Framework:  [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). A framework for building native apps using React.js. React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript.

* Library:  [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). Chosen because it is a powerful library that is built with a reactive way of thinking. This project uses functional components and React Hooks, as a way to show capability to work with latest updates of this library.

* [Expo](https://expo.io/): it's a tool for React Native who gives easy access to devices native API without the need to touch in native code.

* Type checking: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).  Is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for a better standardized code.

* Well moduled and componentially structured.
